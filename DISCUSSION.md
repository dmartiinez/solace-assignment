Other things that I could think about doing if I had more time. 
1. Do some sort of search enhancement, like maybe caching some common search terms to improve performance. Maybe some better matching functionality too.
2. Further handle errors on the frontend
3. Add accessibility
4. MAKE IT RESPONSIVE - mobile first and spend more time on improving the design.
