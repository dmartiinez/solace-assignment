Other things that I could think about doing if I had more time. 
1. Do some sort of search enhancement, like maybe caching some common search terms to improve performance. Maybe some better matching functionality too.
2. move the filtering from the frontend to the backend in api/advocates/route.ts with sql queries when fetching data instead of returning all data and then filtering. This is not scalable
3. Further handle errors on the frontend
4. Add accessibility
5. MAKE IT RESPONSIVE - mobile first and spend more time on improving the design.
